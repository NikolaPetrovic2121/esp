# 👋 Hi, I'm Nikola

💻 An IoT tinkerer & electronics enthusiast with an ESP32 in one hand and a soldering iron in the other.

I build compact systems that solve real-world problems — from auto-watering plants and motion-triggered alarms, to Telegram-powered bots and security tools based on the ESP32 Marauder project.

## 🔐 What I'm focused on

Currently diving deep into **Cybersecurity**, exploring embedded tools like the **ESP32 Marauder**, and building low-level systems for device reconnaissance, wireless fuzzing, and physical layer attacks.

---
Open on new field like backend and fronted developing

## 🛠️ What I work with

- **ESP32/ESP8266** + Arduino IDE / PlatformIO  
- WiFi bots, Telegram APIs, RESTful communication  
- Sensors: PIR, IR, DHT11, capacitive soil moisture  
- Displays: OLEDs, LCDs, serial UI debugging  
- Breadboarding, signal analysis, voltage tracking  
- Soldering — yes, the actual kind. Flux included. 🔥

## 🚀 Projects that define me

- 💧 [Smart Irrigation System](#) — auto-waters plants using soil moisture sensor  
- 🏠 [Home Alarm System](#) — buzzes intruders using PIR + ESP32  
- 🤖 [ESP32 Telegram Bot](#) — controls devices with chat commands  
- 🔓 [ESP32 Marauder Toolkit *(WIP)*](#) — cybersecurity on a chip  
- 🧘‍♂️ [Posture Monitor *(concept)*](#) — tracking motion & improving habits

## 🧠 Currently learning

- Ethical hacking & RF security principles  
- Linux on tablets for portable pentesting  
- How to perfectly crisp prawns in a pan — crunchy outside, buttery inside 🦐🔥  
> _(Because debugging code is like cooking: a balance of heat, patience & good tools.)_

> I like my circuits stable, my bots responsive, and my solder joints shiny.  
> Always learning, always building — one voltage at a time.
